The clearest and simple example of this is when designing a chatbot - you want it to remember previous messages so it can use context from that to have a better conversation. This would be a type of \"short-term memory\". On the more complex side, you could imagine a chain/agent remembering key pieces of information over time - this would be a form of \"long-term memory\". For more concrete ideas on the latter, see this [awesome paper](https://memprompt.com/).\n",
